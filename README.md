adblocker.cfg is a config file that blocks 99% of pinion (and other) advertisements in source games. Copy and paste this file into the proper directory for custom configs (most source games have a different location now) and make an autoexec.cfg with the line "exec adblocker" to load it. Read the included directions and follow them very closely.
